# CI workflow: runs lint, tests, and build on every push/PR to main.

name: CI

# When to run this workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]      # On pushes to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]       # On PRs targeting main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    # Use GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Get the repo code so later steps can run against it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Install Node.js so we can run npm; cache speeds up future runs
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"   # Cache node_modules (and npm store) between runs

      # Install exact versions from package-lock.json (recommended for CI)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Run ESLint; fails if there are errors or too many warnings
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      # Run test suite once (no watch mode). test:ci = vitest run
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:ci
        # Alternative if no test:ci script: npm run test -- --run

      # TypeScript compile + Vite production build; must succeed to pass CI
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
